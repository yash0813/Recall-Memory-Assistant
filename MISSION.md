# Mission: Recall

> **The "Always-on" AI memory aid for early-stage dementia.**
> *Reconnecting the dots of a life well-lived.*

## 1. The Core Problem (Impact)
*   **Target Audience:** Early-to-mid stage dementia patients and their caregivers.
*   **Pain Point:** The terrifying loss of *context*. "Who is this person?", "Where am I?", "What did I do yesterday?". This leads to anxiety, social withdrawal, and caregiver burnout.
*   **The Solution:** An AI companion that sees what you see and whispers the missing context back to you. Not a "database query", but a warm, familiar voice.

## 2. The Gemini 3 Advantage (Technical Depth)
We are not just matching faces. We are reasoning about *relationships* and *history*.
*   **Multimodality:** Input = Real-time Camera Feed + Photo Albums.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   *Input:* Image of a young man holding a fishing rod.
    *   *Old Way:* "Person, Male, holding rod."
    *   *Gemini 3 Way:* "That is your grandson, David. You taught him to fish at Lake Tahoe in 1998. He loves that old reel you gave him." (Synthesis of visual data + long-context history).
*   **Long-Context:** The "Life Graph". We feed Gemini entire PDFs of journals, photo metadata, and chat logs to build a "Theory of Mind" for the user.

## 3. The "Vibe" User Experience (Creativity)
*   **Design Philosophy:** "Invisible Tech". No menus. No login screens. No "Submit" buttons.
*   **Interface:**
    *   **The Lens:** A simple camera view with soft, glowing edges.
    *   **The Whisper:** Text appears as if typed by a typewriter, slow and distinct.
    *   **Audio First:** Soothing, natural voice output (ElevenLabs or standard TTS).
*   **Aesthetic:** Warm creamy backgrounds, large serif typography (Times New Roman / Georgia), high contrast for readability. Nostalgic but modern.

## 4. Hackathon Success Criteria
*   [ ] **The Wow Moment:** Live demo where we show an "Unknown" photo, and Recall identifies it *and* tells a story about it from the "Knowledge Base".
*   [ ] **Usability:** A child or senior must be able to use it instantly.
